# Vue+Node+Express+Userfront Get Data from Backend Service

This repo is based on the repo for Part 1: Vue.js authentication and access example:

https://github.com/theship/userfront-vue

This, Part 2, is to get user data from your backend service after you've added Userfront to your project.

## Install Node and Express

From main project file:

> mkdir server
> cd server
> npm init -y

> npm install express dotenv jsonwebtoken cors

## Create a server app and middleware

* Create a [server/app.js](server/app.js) file and include the code.
* Create a [server/authMiddleware.js](server/authMiddleware.js) file and include the code.

## Install the Userfront public key

## In the client

Update the client side code as discussed in that [README.md](../client/README.md) file.
