# userfront-vue-server

This repo is Part 2 of an example of using Userfront in a Vue+Node+Express application.

Part 1 is at [https://github.com/theship/userfront-vue/](https://github.com/theship/userfront-vue/).

## Add a server

For this part 2, we add a server to validate if the user is an admin. Then, on the client side, we display an admin panel if the user is an admin.

To follow along:

1. Build the server according to that [README.md](./server/README.md) file.
2. Modify the client from Part 1 according to that [README.md](./client/README.md) file.
